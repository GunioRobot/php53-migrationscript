What is this?
----------------
This is the script I used to convert a PHP project from the PEAR naming and
package conventions to the PHP 5.3 namespace conventions.
For example a file named MyApp_Service_UserService would be named to UserService.
References to MyApp_Service_UserService in other files will be changed to
\MyApp\Service\UserService

How to use it?
-------------------
Call the php script from command line and pass the directory where the files
reside which you want to convert.
